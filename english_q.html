            <p>A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT IN ONEIDA, NEW YORK
                <br>
                <br>
                In the nineteenth century there was a village called Oneida in New York State
                where a "family" of 300 members lived together in a large beautiful house
                where they shared everything.
                A man named John Humphrey Noyes, and a small group of people moved
                there in 1848. They wanted a place where they could live according to their
                particular beliefs in their efforts to create a more equal society.
                Today, this place is touristic and, like me, many visitors come because they had
                relatives among those 19th century dreamers. Others just want to see for
                themselves the building where this successful social group in American history
                lived. “I don’t know of anywhere else where you can live in a historical place,”
                said the director of the Oneida site. “It’s very unusual.”
                The present owners share the building with guests who stay in large
                comfortably furnished bedrooms with private baths. There are eight guest
                rooms in the hotel area, and each guest pays $100 for a big bedroom, a simple
                breakfast and a private tour of the 10,300-square-meter building, which also
                contains 35 apartments.
                The library and the building’s grounds are also open to guests, as well as several
                of the public rooms. The 170-year-old library, unchanged from the original
                construction, holds a rich collection of 19th century books and magazines,
                which learners used to study Latin, Greek, algebra and astronomy.
                This place is open for everybody and it’s worth a visit.</p>
